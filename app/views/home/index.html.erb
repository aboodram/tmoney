				<p>During college I studied Philosophy. I started programming after I graduated. </p>
				<p>I'm naturally curious and chose to study philosohpy to change the way I think and reason. It worked. And i'm a better reader, listener and thinker because of it.</p>
				<p>I had a class concerning "The philosophy of Language, Mind and Reality" which sparked my interest in linguistics.</p>
				<p>After college, it was my brother who inspired my interest in programming. After a few lessons I knew I had found my passion in the workplace. The only thing left to do was become as valuable as possible through study and experience.</p>

			Vivint - Current
			Video Production & Web Design
			Vivint's training department recruited me from MoneyDesktop because of my background in front-end web development and videography work. I was given a 37 percent

			I work on Vivint's intranet site dedicated to providing training for +2000 employees.

			MoneyDesktop - Aug. 20
			I was recruited to MoneyDesktop after I attended a URUG (Utah Ruby Users Group) meeting hosted at the MD office in Provo, UT. I worked on the MoneyDesktop app that won 2 Finnovate Best In Show Awards while I was at MD.

			I joined the Front-End team as a HTML/CSS developer. I wrote HTML/CSS that worked in all browsers (IE version 8) and wrote the email templates (a lot of tables and inline CSS).  

			We used Backbone, Require.js, Git, Teabag, Underscore and jQuery. I started learning object oriented javascript.  

			My last project at MD was to take all the existing CSS, write standards, remove duplicates and make the code discoverable (simple) & modular.  I started studying CSS libraries and took the knife to code.  I removed hundreds of lines of code and the app looked pixel perfect.
