			<h1>My History</h1>
			<p>OrangeSoda has great leadership and <span>a great culture</span>. I built Wordpress sites for them and followed their pixel-perfect expectations. I started learning enhancing my experience with HMTL/CSS. I also started learning the <span>fundamentals of choosing excellent color palettes</span> and making good alignment &amp; page structure decisions.</p>
			<p>I made hundreds of web pages using Wordpress. After I finished my work for the day I would jump online and <span>practice HTML &amp; CSS</span>.</p>
